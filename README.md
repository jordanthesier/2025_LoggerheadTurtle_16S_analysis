# How does microbial diversity of loggerhead sea turtles (*Caretta caretta*) change with age?

## BIOMI6300 16S Amplion Sequencing Project

### Project Background
---

This project was done as a part of BIOMI6300 *Computational Approaches for Microbial Systems* at Cornell University with Dr. Mar Schmidt.

This work was done using a dataset from the paper [Loggerhead Sea Turtles as Hosts of Diverse Bacterial and Fungal Communities.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-024-02388-x#change-history)

I specifically chose the dataset with cloacal, oral, and tank water samples from the [ENA Project PRJEB62752.](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB62752)

From 2019-2021, 18 loggerhead sea turtles were found strained, injured, or unintentionally caught by fishermen around the Adriatic Sea, and were transported to recovery centers to receive appropriate treatment. This included 10 juveniles, 4 sub-adults, and 4 adults. Endozoic samples were collected from cloacal and oral cavities in triplicate by sterile synthetic swabs (Aptaca Nuova), and when available, enclosure tank water was collected in sterile containers, vacuum filtered on 0.2-Î¼m sterile Whatman polycarbonate membrane filters (Sigma-Aldrich), and stored in 2-ml tubes in 96% EtOH.

DNA was extracted with DNeasy PowerSoil kit (Qiagen).

16S amplicions of the V3-4 region were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq v3 300x2 bp paired-end.

### Hypotheses regarding loggerhead sea turtle microbial communities
---

**Null Hypothesis:** Alpha and beta diversity do not vary with age.

**Alternative Hypothesis #1:** Alpha diversity increases with age.

**Alternative Hypothesis #2:** Microbial composition will become more similar with age.

**Alternative Hypothesis #3:** Rare members are unique to juveniles compared to adults.
